# Theme Usage

1. Move the 'wp-config.php' and 'wp-config-dev.php' files into the root of the WordPress install and customize them. Don't upload wp-config-dev to your live/production environment — keep it in your local environment only.
2. Delete the empty '_site_root_files' directory.
3. Replace the 'img/logo.png' with your own logo.
4. Edit the logo file height and width dimensions on lines 9 and 10 of 'inc/admin/login-config.php'.
5. Search for 'baseline' (case sensitive) and replace it with an all-lowercase, no spaces version of your theme name.
6. Search for 'Baseline' (case sensitive) across all theme files and replace it with a "friendly" version of your theme name.
7. As you're building your site, don't forget to:
a) Modify the editor window styles to match the site (in 'inc/admin/editor-style.less')
b) Modify the content width in 'inc/admin/login-config.php';
c) Customize the appearance/hiding of default widgets by editing 'inc/admin/remove-default-widgets.php'
9. Further customize the theme to make it yours!
